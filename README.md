# identity.SN
A social network that helps to facilitate real connections between people with diverse backgrounds by matching users for <b>one-on-one</b> 24-hour chats
 
A project for [Code:Buffalo Hackathon presented by 43North](https://www.43north.org/code-buffalo/). To better unify people, team Bonnies developed <b>identity.SN</b> toprovide an anoynymous social network platform for people of Buffalo and beyond to have more meaningful conversations about potentially divisive topics and make long-lasting connections.

# Who #

We intend out platform to be available to all people regardless of their identities. However, due to the early stage of development, we expect initial adoption by younger, more tech-savvy audience.

# Features #
* The platform algorithmically matches user based on their identities and interests
* Users stay anonymous: share anything or everything worries-free
* User has 24-hour to chat with their match. By doing so, people will have time to reflect and build these connections
* During that 24 hours, users can decide to chat face-to-face through a video call
* At any time, user can delete the match and start over

# Tech #
* Vue.js
* Sails.js
* Amazon RDS
* AI Watson Framework

# Future Plans #
We intend to expand our app and let people across the US to join and start making these connections by 6 months. For a far future, if all permits, we might go international or make this into a diversity training module for work or school purposes. 

# Thoughts # 
identity.SN not only gave our team more technical and collaboration experiences and skills, but it also taught all of us about our identities and the importance of human connections in the times of COVID-19.
